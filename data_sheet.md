# Datasheet Template

## Motivation

- **For what purpose was the dataset created?**  
  The dataset is daily market data for the SSE Composite Index, originally created for financial information and analytics (e.g. by exchanges and data vendors) and subsequently aggregated and distributed by Yahoo Finance.  
  In this project, the dataset is used to research and evaluate a machine-learning ensemble trading strategy, with emphasis on risk-adjusted performance (Sortino ratio) rather than live trading execution.

- **Who created the dataset, and who funded it?**  
  The underlying market data is generated by the Shanghai Stock Exchange through its trading activity. It is collected, processed, and redistributed by Yahoo Finance. The project itself does not create new data; it only downloads and processes data made available by Yahoo/Yahoo Finance and the exchange.  
  Funding for the original dataset comes indirectly from exchange operations, listing fees, and the business model of data vendors. This repository does not receive funding from those entities and simply consumes publicly accessible historical data.

## Composition

- **What do the instances represent?**  
  Each instance is a single **trading day** for the SSE Composite Index. For each day, the dataset contains:
  - Open price  
  - High price  
  - Low price  
  - Close price  
  - Adjusted close price  
  - Volume  

- **How many instances of each type are there?**  
  The exact number of rows depends on the date when the script is run, because data is pulled up to the most recent available trading day. For a start date of 2010-01-01, you can expect several thousand daily observations (roughly the number of trading days since 2010).

- **Is there any missing data?**  
  - The raw download may contain `NaN` values (e.g. for early days, holidays, or partial records).  
  - The code explicitly calls `data.dropna()` after downloading, so rows with missing OHLCV fields are removed before modelling.  
  - After indicator computation, additional rows at the beginning of the series are dropped due to indicator warm-up (e.g., 200-day EMA).

- **Does the dataset contain confidential data?**  
  No.  
  - The dataset consists solely of aggregated market index prices and volumes.  
  - There is no personally identifiable information (PII) and no confidential communication.  
  - Data is public market information.

## Collection process

- **How was the data acquired?**  
  The data is acquired programmatically via the Python `yfinance` library, which accesses historical price data from Yahoo Finance. The code uses:

  ```python
  ticker = "000001.SS"
  data = yf.download(
      ticker,
      start="2010-01-01",
      end=None,
      interval="1d",
      auto_adjust=False
  )
